Overview of this project and its purpose.

This project aims to analyse and compare voter priorities with media/newspaper coverage leading up to national elections in the UK for the years 2010, 2015, and 2017. By leveraging survey data from YouGov and media articles from the Poldem dataset, we seek to understand if the issues that matter most to voters are adequately represented in the media. The project involves data extraction, cleaning, storage, and visualization using Python, Flask, SQLite, Apex and D3.js.

To do this we have created a series of wordclouds that disply the most common keywords in newspaper headlines at a time selected.  The larger the word, the more often it appeared.

To run alongside this line charts were created to show how important those surveyed viewed certain issues.  The purpose of this project is to compare and analyse whether if an issue is important to the electorate, is it reported, and to what extent?  We can then compare whether what was viewed as important was the most reported issue i.e. if Tax was the biggest word in the wordcloud, does it also have the highest percentage when it comes to survey data as being the most important issue to votors?  If this is not the case, what are the reasons for this?

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project.  You can then use the index file which will create the relevant visualisations.

You will hve access to our Github repository that contains the necessary files.  

On the left hand side of the page you will see check boxes which you can use to select a range of years and issues.  A wordcloud will be created that will highlight the overall popularity of key issues in newspaper reporting, and a line graph is generated to show how popular that issue is with survey repsondents.  You can then analyse them to see if there is a correlation between the two. 
The Project Purpose

Ethical Considerations.

To ensure data accuracy and integrity, we have used only well established and reputable sources and have not manipulated the data in any way.  In terms of transparency, we have been clear in using data from YouGov and Poldem websites.  The original data can be found at https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/trackers/the-most-important-issues-facing-the-country for YouGov and at https://poldem.eui.eu/data-overview/ for Poldem.

YouGov data was supplied without any names - it was all anonymous.  However with Poldem in some cases specific politicians were mentioned to give context to newspaper headlines.  We decided to keep these in because it preserves data accuracy as we have not changed the raw data - we are presenting what it is - and Poldem themselves follow ethical guidelines themselves when generating the data.

We have removed our own personal bias by using this survey data only and does not include the team's personal views as to what is important.  YouGov and Poldem themselves have stringent methodologies that they follow to prevent bias and to ensure fair representation.
